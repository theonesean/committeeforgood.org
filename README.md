## The Pledge

[pledge](#pledge)

Membership in the Committee for Good entails taking the following pledge: 

*As a member of the Allegheny County Democratic Committee, we pledge to support and advance the following policies:*

### 1. Healthcare for all, free of charge.

We need a healthcare system that guarantees care for everybody, including reproductive healthcare, regardless of employment or ability to pay. We need to follow the lead of almost every other “first world” country and guarantee healthcare as a right, through a system such as Medicare-For-All.

### 2. $15/hour minimum wage nationwide

Everyone should be getting a living wage. While $15 an hour falls short of the inflation-adjusted $16.06 an hour Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr’s March on Washington called for ($2/hr in 1968), it’s the direction we need. We should also adopt the proposed Obama administration rule to increase the time-and-a-half for overtime pay threshold.

### 3. Stop right-to-work (for less) and right-to-fire (at-will).

We stand against so-called “right to work for less” legislation that attacks unions and encourages freeloading on union-negotiated contracts. In addition, we need to end at-will employment and establish a just-cause standard so employers cannot fire employees on a whim.

*By affixing my name and information to the following form, I hereby sign on to the Platform of the Committee for Good.*
